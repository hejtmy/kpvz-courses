### 2. **Data Collection & Marketing**
- **Data Brokers:** Major players include Acxiom, Oracle Data Cloud,
Experian, Equifax, TransUnion
- **What They Collect:** Demographics, financial data, online behavior,
health information, location history, political affiliations

restrictions in EU

### 3. **Cognitive Warfare**

The presentation details how psychological operations exploit human
cognitive vulnerabilities:

**Core Concepts:**
- **Overton Window Shift:** Normalizing extreme ideas through gradual
exposure
- **Memes:** Cultural units that spread ideas, emotions, and tribal
identities
- **Narratives:** Story frameworks that promote specific worldviews
- **Dark UX Patterns:** Manipulative design tactics including
misinformation loops, echo chambers, fear appeals

**Psychological Exploits:**
- Cognitive biases (confirmation bias, bandwagon effect)
- Emotional decision-making over logic
- Information overload leading to uncritical acceptance
- Social identity manipulation (us vs. them tribalism)

**Real-World Example:** Operation SIMCARTEL - Europol operation that
seized 40,000 SIM cards used to create 49 million fake online identities
for fraud and influence operations.

### 4. **NLP Detection & Analysis**

**Four AI/NLP Techniques for Narrative Intelligence:**

1. **NER (Named Entity Recognition):** Identifies persons,
organizations, locations, dates
2. **POS (Part of Speech):** Grammatical categorization for syntactic
analysis
3. **Topic Modeling:** Discovers hidden thematic structures using
BERTopic
4. **Sentiment Analysis:** Classifies emotions (polarity: -1 to +1;
subjectivity: 0 to 1)

**Applications:**
- Automated detection of disinformation campaigns
- Narrative tracking across multiple sources
- Identifying coordinated inauthentic behavior
- Protecting analyst mental health through automation

**Tools & Research:**
